        This project was done in a group of 7 as a Bachelor Project for the Media Technology program.
        The purpose and goal of this project were to create an Air hockey game for a touch table that
        corresponds to the size of an actual Air hockey table. In accordance with the customer's requirements,
        the game was developed to be exhibited in an exhibition environment. The main focus of the project
        was to create a unique gaming experience with clear feedback that increases players' understanding
        of the game's functionality.
      </p>
      <p class="p-text">
        At the request of the course management, the project was carried out in accordance with the
        Scrum method. The method was based on the distribution of tasks in connection with time, priorities
        and continuous changes in customer requirements. The agile approach was based on the division of
        the project into sprints.
      </p>
      <p class="p-text">
        The game was developed in the Unity game engine with Microsoft Visual Studio as IDE and GitHub as
        version control tools. Game physics was developed by the project group after examining various solutions,
        including Unity's own collision management. The design and user interface were inspired by the classic
        Air hockey game with the exhibition environment and the target platform in mind. The target platform
        was important as the size of the touchpad affected, among other things, the placement of the objects.
        Various forms of feedback were then used to improve the players' understanding of the game.
      </p>
      <p class="p-text">
        The result of the project was a working Air hockey game that could be played on a touch table. Like
        regular Air hockey, two players can play against each other. In addition to the usual functionality
        of an Air hockey game, there are also power-ups that can be taken up by the players, which either
        simplify or complicate the game.
